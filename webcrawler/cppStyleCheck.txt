  Cyclomatic Complexity Error (Max Complexity Allowed = 10):
    Line 342: In function bool HTMLParserTest(ostream & os, bool success)
      Function has cyclomatic complexity of 17

  Function Length Error (Max Function Length Allowed = 50):
    Line 182: In function bool URLTest(ostream & os, bool success)
      Function length of 114
    Line 342: In function bool HTMLParserTest(ostream & os, bool success)
      Function length of 70
    Line 501: In function bool WordIndexTest(ostream & os, bool success)
      Function length of 79



Justifications:
    Cyclomatic Complexity Error: Cyclomatic Complexity gives an indication of the number of basic paths through a function. A function with high Cyclomatic Complexity becomes difficult to understand.
    Function Length Error: Long functions are often not decomposed enough, and it is hard to tell what they do.
